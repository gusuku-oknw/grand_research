# SIS Image Sharing Package

This repository packages the original **Searchable Image Sharing (SIS)** demos into an installable Python module named **`sis_image`**.
It provides modular, reproducible research components for privacy-preserving image search and reconstruction, using perceptual hashing (`pHash`) and Shamir secret sharing.

---

## 🔧 Features

The `sis_image` package implements reusable building blocks:

* **64-bit perceptual hashing (`pHash`)** — DCT-based perceptual similarity hashing.
* **Shamir secret sharing** — secure split & recovery for hash bytes and RGB images.
* **Searchable SIS index** — banded HMAC tokens for secure candidate preselection.
* **Persistent image store** — reconstructs full images from any `k` of `n` servers.
* **Modular experiment runners (`sis_modes/`)** — independently testable Stage-A/B/C pipelines.

## 🧩 Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

For quick experimentation:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧪 Command-Line Demos

Once installed, the package provides a unified CLI entry point:

```bash
sis-image selective-demo --images_dir data/
sis-image search-demo --images_dir data/ --reconstruct_top 2
sis-image image-store-demo --images_dir data/
sis-image secure-demo --images_dir data/
```

Each original demo under `SIS_image/` now delegates to these commands for reproducibility.

The repository also includes a visualization demo:

```bash
python demo_k_sweep.py --share_strategy phash-fusion --output figures/k_sweep.png
```

This script sweeps over the number of responding servers, plots the top-ranked Hamming distance, and highlights when the fusion fallback activates (k < required). The generated `k_sweep.png` makes it easy to see how rankings/reconstruction degrade as servers drop out.

Another visual helper is `demo_k_vs_strategy.py`:

```bash
python demo_k_vs_strategy.py --share_strategy phash-fusion --output figures/k_strategy_compare.png
```

It runs both the pure Shamir pipeline and the fusion hash pipeline for every `k` from 1 to `n`, then draws the top-ranked Hamming distance and reconstruction counts per strategy so you can directly compare how the result “looks” as servers become available.

To see the **actual images** the system would pick/reconstruct as `k` increases, use:

```bash
python demo_k_recovery_gallery.py --output figures/k_recovery_gallery.png
```

Fusion-mode cells blend the candidate with a progressively blurred version based on the Hamming distance, so you can see how pHash融合型 returns “fuzzy” approximations when `k` is short while Shamir simply waits until enough shares exist.

It arranges the recovered/candidate image per `k` for both strategies so you can visually trace how Shamir waits until `k` is reached while the fusion variant continually surfaces the nearest perceptual match.

If you don't have a curated dataset, generate synthetic noise images with:

```bash
python experiments/scripts/generate_noise_images.py --count 20 --size 128 128 --output_dir data/noise
```

These PNGs provide a quick visual workload for the demo scripts so you can inspect how noise versus real images behave as `k` changes.

## ⚙️ Modular Experiment Architecture

Experiment scripts under `experiments/scripts/` are now **mode-based** and follow a shared interface.

```
experiments/scripts/
  run_search_experiments.py      # orchestrator (lightweight)
experiments/modes/
  base_runner.py                 # abstract ModeRunner and helpers
  plain.py                       # baseline pHash ranking
  sis_naive.py                   # full reconstruction baseline
  sis_selective.py               # Stage-B selective reconstruction
  sis_staged.py                  # staged refinement pipeline
  sis_mpc.py                     # MPC-style fully private variant
```

### Design Philosophy and Architecture

The core of this research is to **achieve both computational efficiency and confidentiality by first narrowing down candidates with pHash, and then calculating distances using MPC (Multi-Party Computation) while the data remains in its secret-shared (SIS) state.**

The conventional, naive approach of "reconstruct all images, then search in plaintext" is computationally expensive and carries privacy risks. This system completes the process within the framework of secret sharing and MPC, without ever converting the original images or their pHashes back to plaintext.

A note on terminology: Unlike cryptographic "decryption," SIS involves gathering shares to restore the original information. Therefore, this document uses the term "**reconstruction**."

### Three-Stage Search Pipeline

The search is executed as a three-stage pipeline, starting with the least computationally intensive operations to progressively filter candidates.

- **Stage-A (Index-based Candidate Reduction)**
  HMAC tokens generated from the query image's pHash are matched against the index on each server to select an initial set of candidates. This stage efficiently reduces the search space to a small percentage of the total corpus (≪N).

- **Stage-B (On-Demand pHash Reconstruction)**
  Only for candidates that pass Stage-A, pHash SIS shares are partially fetched and reconstructed on-demand. This is performed in modes like `sis_selective` when a more detailed comparison is needed.

- **Stage-C (Secure Distance Calculation via MPC)**
  For the final candidates (L items), the Hamming distance is calculated **using MPC on the SIS shares without reconstructing the plaintext pHash**. This allows servers to securely compare distances without ever learning the pHash values.

The final image **reconstruction** is explicitly separate from the search process. It is performed only when the original image is truly needed, based on the K-of-N threshold scheme, and typically occurs on the client-side.

### Why It's Fast and Secure

- **Reduced Computational Complexity**: The workload is significantly reduced by limiting comparisons from O(N) for the entire dataset to O(|candidates|) for a small subset.
- **No Plaintext Exposure**: High confidentiality is maintained because neither the original images nor their pHashes are reconstructed into plaintext during the search process.
- **Scalability**: The most computationally expensive operation, MPC, is reserved for the small number of final candidates, ensuring the system remains scalable.

### Considerations and Future Work

- **Access Pattern Leakage**: Information about which HMAC tokens matched the index (the access pattern) can be leaked. This could be mitigated by introducing dummy queries or by batching queries to anonymize them.
- **Key Management**: It is recommended to use separate HMAC keys for each band and to rotate them periodically. The future use of an OPRF (Oblivious Pseudorandom Function) is desirable.
- **MPC Implementation**: The current implementation is a simulated MPC that performs "reconstruction -> distance calculation" for demonstration purposes. For practical applications, this should be replaced with a true MPC protocol or a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment).

### Mode-specific Stage Usage

| Mode | Stage-A | Stage-B | Stage-C |
| :--- | :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `plain` | ❌ (Scans all with pHash distance) | ❌ | ✅ Sorts by distance with `compute_plain_distances` |
| `sis_naive` | ❌ (No candidate reduction) | ❌ | ✅ Reconstructs and evaluates all candidates with `rank_candidates` |
| `sis_selective` | ✅ Reduces candidates with HMAC voting | ✅ Inspects partial shares with `stage_b_filter` | ✅ Reconstructs and evaluates only Top-K |
| `sis_staged` | ✅ (Same as `sis_selective`) | ✅ | ✅ |
| `sis_mpc` | ✅ HMAC voting | ❌ (Skipped to prevent leakage) | ✅ MPC ranking with `rank_candidates_secure` (no reconstruction) |

All modes conform to the same `ModeRunner` interface in `sis_modes/base.py`, making experiments interchangeable and their results comparable.
